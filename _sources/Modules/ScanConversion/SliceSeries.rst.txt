  Screenshot of the ScanConvertSliceSeries module output. This prostate image
  comes from a transrectal probe that is mechanically rotated at angles
  that are not necessarily uniform.

  This output can be reproduced by running the ``ScanConvertSliceSeriesTest``
  test in the project repository. Example input data can be found `here
